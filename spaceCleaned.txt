Can you imagine a world where we're all represented by a font? Huh. I wonder which one I would be. Too straight. No! Not in that way! Just straight... as in unexciting. Too... Uh... Deadpool. [Piano riffs] Broadway! [Singing] Now that's the one! Now that's the one!~ [Intro] Hello Internet! Welcome to Game Theory! Where instead of putting a joke here, I wanna ask you a question. If your personality were represented by a font, what font would you be? Take a moment and put your font in the comments. I'm really curious to see what everyone has to say. Maybe find a couple new cool fonts to use. Getting bored with old Calibri 11. And with that out of the way, it's time to talk Undertale. Now I don't think I've ever gotten this many requests to cover a game. Well... Except for FNAF... And I suppose FNAF 2 Oh! And then there was FNAF 3 Wait a minute. Should I-should I be worried about something here? Anyway, across the board on YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter, you all have wanted Undertale. And honestly, I'm glad you brought it to my attention. True loyal Theorists will know that EarthBound is my favorite game of all time. So a self-aware RPG in a similar style... Oh-hoh man! It's like a gift from the indie-gaming heavens! Undertale is a game where every character from Goat Mom to grind fodder has a sympathetic design and unique personality. Motivations, goals, fears. Whether you're saving or slaughtering them, the game makes you feel something every time you enter an encounter. But to me, one character stood out amongst all the rest. Sans. A skeleton names after the font "Comic Sans" Hence all the font references at the beginning of the episode. If you haven't played Undertale, I'm sure that was a really weird opening. Anyways, Sans is... well... there's a lot of mystery around this guy. And before we get into it, let me put up a very special SPOILER WARNING. Undertale is a game best experienced blind. So if you haven't played it, pause the video and come back after you finished. I promise you. I PROMISE you won't regret it. Alright, so everyone out of the pool and ready for the adult swim? Good. Because I'm feeling pretty determined to get to the bottom of Sans' mystery. So just a recap for those of you who haven't played the game and ignored the SPOILER WARNING or just need a refresher, Sans is one of the two skeletal brothers who appear in the game. His partner is Papyrus. A loud, goofy, trap lover also named after a font. But in the world of Undertale, their origins are a big question mark. All that we really know is what's given to us by a shopkeeper in Snowdin. Who explains that Sans and Papyrus, quote: "just showed up one day and...asserted themselves" Weird, right? What's more is that, well, Papyrus is just kinda the goofy sidekick, Sans is much more complex. Sure, he likes fart jokes, but he's also incredibly powerful and deadly serious. Not only is his boss battle the hardest in the game, he's one of the only characters to have knowledge and power over space and time. He often takes shortcuts around the world through ridiculous routes even walking through walls. He also acknowledges that he's only one of infinite versions of himself. Making self-aware commentary of the various timelines that you've played through in the game. He can even count the number of times he's killed you. He acts like an arbiter in this world, passing out judgement on the player's actions in the game Even explaining the secrets of EXP and LOVE or, Execution Points and Level of Violence, just to clarify. In short, he just, doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the world of monsters. But then... what, or WHO is he? Well, the idea that he doesn't belong in Underworld seems to be correct. The evidence seems to point to the fact that he was, in fact, formerly a surface dweller. In the True Pacifist ending of the game as the group looks out onto the horizon, Papyrus asks Sans about the giant ball in the sky. Sans says, quote: "We call that 'the sun'." This is important because: A: The usage of the word "we" and knowledge of the sun shows that Sans has a kinship, or knowledge with other humans, and B: That despite he and Papyrus both being skeletons, are supposedly brothers, and apparently appeared in Underworld at the same time, they [voice crack] clearly Uwah! [BEEP] They clearly have two very different histories. Why would Papyrus not know the name of the sun, but Sans would? We get further clues as to Sans' origin as we hear his say multiple times that he wants to "go home", or "go back". He says as much during his dinner date scene at the Mettaton Hotel. He notices that the player must wanna go home and says, quote: "I know the feeling." He then continues: [QUOTE ON SCREEN] As though he ended up in Underworld by accident. And, in the Genocide run during his boss fight, he says, quote: "Look. I gave up trying to go back a long time ago." End quote. And before you say he means going back to the surface world, that's clearly not the full story. His very next line of dialogue is: "and getting to the surface doesn't really appeal anymore, either." Keyword here is "either". Yes, he seems to hail from the surface and wants to go back but based on his dialogue, he no longer considers it his home. It's as though the surface world he once knew is gone. As though he's from a different time. It's pretty intriguing. So, we're left with a being that appeared out of nowhere, presumably from the human surface, but from a different time period. Who seemingly has the power to teleport. That's a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. But here's where things get really interesting... Sans has a hidden workshop that takes a fair amount of searching to find. You could say it takes a lot of... Determination to unlock. Anyway, obligatory "determination" references aside... As you start to look for this Easter egg, Sans gives you a key to his room with the words: It's time you learned the truth. After some searching, you find the workshop which contains items that leave even more questions. A photo album featuring Sans and a bunch of smiling people you don't recognize, a badge, blueprints with illegible handwriting, and a broken machine hidden behind a curtain. In the latest update, one more detail was added. A hand drawn picture of three smiling faces with the words " don't forget". So, what's it all mean? Well, a lot of Undertale theorists have been linking these details to a mysterious figure named a W.D. Gaster. A ghostly character who never truly appears in the game. Honestly, covering him is a theory all onto itself and probably one best saved for another day. Even still, none of the Gaster theories I've seen have been able to explain all the details. In particular, the photo album and the badge. And that's what kept nagging me as I researched Undertale. A badge? That one in particular really stuck out to me. Why would such an oddly specific item be included in the huge Easter egg of a room? Something that's supposedly reveals the truth about Sans. Badges just aren't important in Undertale. And then it hit me. What if it wasn't from Undertale? What if this badge was from a completely different game, and was in fact, the most important badge in the history of gaming? The Franklin Badge. Now for those of you wondering what I'm talking about, the Franklin Badge is a pivotal item from the Mother series. You know, the one with EarthBound or... maybe you don't know that one either. Uh... You know, the one that Ness from Super Smash Brothers? Yeah well, Ness is from EarthBound and EarthBound is the second part in this larger Mother trilogy. Alright? Good. Anyway, the Franklin Badge is a really important part of that series. It gets its start in the very first game and carries through the whole trilogy. Saving your life multiple times in the process. It's so important, that Nintendo has made it a staple item in the Smash Brothers series. So I asked myself, what if the badge in Sans' drawer was that exact badge? Well first off, it would make Undertale connected to my favorite game thereby making it even cooler! But that's still a pretty big logical leap. I needed more. And let me tell you, as I started looking, more and more pieces started to fit into place. At the end of EarthBound, you're given a photo album, covering your adventures throughout the game. To me, it's one of the best, most satisfying endings in gaming to look back on your journey in picture form. And what does Sans happen to have in his other drawer? A photo album filled with pictures of Sans with people you don't recognize. Of course you don't know them. They're not characters present in Undertale. And note the word that's used here: "People" you don't recognize. Not "Underworld monsters". So that's two items oddly linked to the Mother series. But then, how do the blueprints and broken machine fit in? Well, in the final stretch of EarthBound, Ness and his three friends must travel to the past in order to have their final battle against the evil alien Giygas. To do that, Dr. Andonuts... Remember him by the way. He's gonna be important later. With the help of the science geniuses, Apple Kid and Mrselect in the encoding combo "add" and add GB18030 (or GBK). Saturn, create what's known as the "Phase Distorter". A machine that allows people to travel through time and space. Except... It comes with a cost. It can't transport organic materiel. As a result, the young heroes must put their souls into robotic bodies to use the machine and thus save the world. I played this game back in 1997 and I'm not ashamed to admit that when I first saw this scene, I cried. It's devastating. Dr. Andonuts says goodbye to his son, these characters that you've grown to love and care about are suddenly promising to sacrifice their lives. For all they know, there's no possibility of them being able to come back home. It's this incredibly dark departure in the final moments of what was otherwise a fun, quirky, and colorful RPG. So what's this have to do with Undertale? A lot, actually. But the first thing you need to know is that Mr. Saturns are known for their... let's say, unique linguistic style. That would explain the illegible handwriting on the blueprints. And the machine? I think a broken Phase Distorter is behind that curtain. Now that may seem like a stretch, but it actually explains a lot. If Sans wound up in Underworld, via a Phase Distorter, it could provide a reason for why he's a skeleton. He used the machine as organic matter and suffered the concequences. Not killing him, but turning at least a part of him into a pile of bones. It would also explain why Sans has given up hope for going home. Remember, the distorter is a time machine. Being in Underworld, he's not only in a different place, but based on how he talks, he's also in a different time. With no hope of travelling back to the time he came from. But the crossovers between EarthBound and Undertale continue. When you speak to the Apple Kid at the end of EarthBound, he's blown away by the astronomical odds of Ness overcoming Giygas. Saying he's going to continue studying the trait called "courage" in order to harness its power. Seems awfully similar to the same experiments happening in Undertale around the trait of "determination", no? Especially since so much speculation has circulated that Sans is a key player in those experiments. But I'm sure you also want physical evidence, right? Well don't worry, because I have plenty. During one of the endings of Undertale, we see Undyne and Alphys hanging out on the beach on the surface world. A beach that shares a lot of similarities to the tropical resort location named "Summers" that you play through in EarthBound. In fact, the geographic layout of the surface bears some striking similarities to the world of Mother. When Undertale's crew of monsters are finally able to reach the surface and look out over the earth, they're met with a beautiful sunset falling across a landscape of a tall mountain, a large city, and a sandy area adjacent to water. Notice the sun's reflection to indicate water, and a lack of trees in this middle section here, hence the sand. Well, in EarthBound, you have the big city of Fourside, complete with skyscrapers, which you reach via a desert that just so happens to be adjacent to some water, And to the east, the mountain in Onett [pronounced "oh net"] where a meteorite lands on Earth. I always called it Onett [pronounced "on it"] But if that's not clear enough for you, Mother One, "EarthBound Zero", "EarthBound Beginnings" Whatever you want to call it, its had a lot of names. Had a map laying out the same geographic landscape: a tall mountain to the eastof a large city, separated by a desert with all of it up against a cost. I don't know about you, but to me it seems like there's a definite connection between the world of Eagleland [pronounced "Eagle lind] Eagleland? [pronounced "Eagle land"] Again, unclear how it's pronounced. Between the world of Eagleland, and the surface world of Undertale. But the strongest physical connection, the one that definitely unites these two franchises, comes from none other than Papyrus himself. He wears a custom-made costume known as his "battle body". But if you look really closely at the design of the armor, you'll notice some markings on the chest. Is it just a throwaway detail? Ho-hoh no. That right there is an exact match to the ones that appear on the chests of Starmen The most iconic enemy of EarthBound. And look at the way he stands! I always thought it was awkward until I looked at the two characters side by side. Papyrus' curved arm and hand is a direct match to the curved arms of the Starmen in the Mother series! In short, we have some incredibly strong proof that the EarthBound universe is somehow connected to the Undertale world. Which brings us back to our initial question... Who is Sans? Well what if we took it one final step and said that Sans happened to be Ness from EarthBound. Sent through the Phase Distorter during a test of courage, carrying the Franklin Badge and his photo album in his trusty backpack. Not only do all the items in the workshop suddenly fit, bus so does Sans' behavior. Remember, Sans can seemingly teleport, and Ness just so happens to have the PSI ability to teleport. Now look at the way Sans always stands. Hands in his pockets, directly facing the camera, It's a very similar stance to how Ness is depicted standing in most marketing for the game. It even explains why Sans bleeds when you finally hit him. He is, or at least was, a human. Oh, and finally, Sans is only one letter removed from being an anagram for Ness. That's just a fun one. I thought it was worth mentioning. But if there was any doubt, we have to look no further than the creator's previous work. Toby Fox, the man behind Undertale, had previously worked on a Halloween hack for EarthBound. But this just wasn't a simple reskin, the Halloween hack tells the tale of Dr. Andonuts after the events of EarthBound. Remember I pointed him out? He's the one who made the Phase Distorter. In Toby Fox's version of the story, we see that Giygas defeat, the souls of the kids never return home. Instead, by going to the past to defeat Giygas, they create a new timeline that they're stuck in. As a result, Jeff never reunites with his father, Dr. Andonuts. And Dr. Andonuts goes crazy with guilt. Because he's the one responsible for creating the time machine, and extracting the souls of his son and his son's friends to send them back to what he assumes was their death. In his mind, he killed four kids. And in Toby Fox's game, he's lost his mind trying to deal with that guilt. I'm telling you, this hack is dark. But that said, you see a lot of Undertale in this game. The appearance of amalgamates, the first use of the awesome song, Megalovania, The prototypes for Flowey, and the theme of having the choice to be non-violent in an RPG, sparing your enemies. But then, why's this all matter to the theory? Well remember, in Toby Fox's version of the story, the kids don't come back. They're stuck in the past with no hopes of getting home. Just like Sans. And in the hack, one character is oddly missing with no explanation as to why. Ness. Presumably in this timeline, his soul is in a different place than his three friends. Which brings us back to Undertale. Three faces with "don't forget" written on it? It's Ness trying to remember his three friends. In short, Undertale is a continuation of Toby's version of EarthBound, with Ness never being able to get home, adopting the name Sans, and accompanied by Papyrus; a former Starman, an alien force able to speak English and still equipped with his armor and signature posture, but without any knowledge of earthly things, like the sun. The pieces all just seem to fit. Now all we need is an appearance from Pokey/Porky and we've got ourselves a true sequel! But hey, that's just a theory... A Game Theory! Thanks for watching! Now go forth with that knowledge and try to tell me who Gaster is. Don't worry. I'll be looking too. I've a few more Undertale theories in the works as well as a Deadlock, and then there's Goomba with another Culture Shock on the game. So if you're into the franchise, make sure you subscribe to get notified of those videos as they come out over the next few weeks. And hey! If you're interested in learning more about the EarthBound Halloween hack and it's role as a precursor to Undertale, we're currently playing through it live! Our next session is Wednesday 4pm Pacific Time right here on this channel. So check it out. It's super creepy but also super fascinating to see the inner workings of Toby Fox's mind. And if you wanna catch up with what you've missed, BOOM! Here's a link. I think that this clip really sums it up best: [MatPat]: HELL YES MEXICANS! [Claps] Or if you want to learn more about my favorite game, EarthBound, click right here. It's an old theory about the true meaning of the game. With an emphasis on OLD. So go back and laugh at how bad my editing and voice-over was. It's, uh, pretty funny to look back. But honestly, the message about the beauty of EarthBound is just as relevant as ever. Hopefully by you guys watching this episode, and maybe clicking over to watch that episode, I can share with you my all-time favorite game, and quite honestly, one of the best games ever created. But now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go track some human migratory patterns across Southeastern Asia. So I'll see you guys next week. *phone rings* *picks up* MatPat as Phone Guy: Uh.. Hello? Hello hello? Oh, hello, and welcome to the new and improved Five Nights at Freddy's new video! Umm... I'm here to answer any questions the game may of left 'Unanswered.' The game's developer, He's uhh He's a pretty tricky guy. ahem Don't worry though, I'll get everything cleared up. Oh, and uh watch out for the puppet. *static* *Intro. Song: SpellingPhailer - Science Blaster* Hello, internet. Welcome to Game Theory! The show that promises not to include anymore gratuitous jump scares. Unless that's just what I want you to think. So I can lull you into a false sense of security and scare you again! But...I wouldn't do that! I'll just let the uncertainty of whether a jumpscare is going to happen or not drive you insane for the rest of this episode. Ha-ha! Man, I love reverse psychology! You know what else I love? These games! Not because I'm freaked out by the rosy cheeked, Tingle-looking, emotionally dead animatronics. Okay, well Balloon Kid is pretty messed up, but whatever. No, what I appreciate about these games is the level of thought that went into every element of the story. When you create a game that has people rage-debating about whether it's a sequel or a prequel, you've definitely done something right. Unless that was never your intent, in which case you've done something HORRIBLY HORRIBLY WRONG. Anyway, the point is, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 looks to be everything you'd want in a sequel: More cameras, more danger, and more FAN. Ughh, the fan! But that also comes with more questions: questions about the game's lore. And while others will provide you with the jump-scares, I provide you with what everyone really wants: ANSWERS. Well, maybe not everyone. What an elite, educated subset of you REALLY want: ANSWERS. So grab yourselves a slice of Freddy Fazbear's signature pizza, 'cause we're about to dig in. Lugh! Tastes like... Cardboard. Let's get the big one out of the way first; And what I mean by that is, contrary to popular belief, just because it has a big '2' slapped next to the name doesn't automatically mean the game comes after the first one in a timeline sense. It's a sequel, yes, but it tells a prequel story. Take, for instance, these all-time classics: Psycho IV: The Beginning, Lion King 1\BD, and the actual all-time classic, Godfather: Part II. All of them sequels, that just so happen to also be prequels. It's not mutually exclusive. So, where's Five Nights at Freddy's 2 fit in? Knowing it's place in the timeline is crucial for understanding it's story. Well, to figure that out, let's focus on the paycheck you receive at the end of your fifth night. The date places the events of the game in 1987, a whole six years ahead of when we determined the first game took place in our first video. Sounds like a prequel, but we found that date in the first game by calculating Mike Schmidt's hourly pay and comparing that to the minimum wage of the '90's. If Scott Cawthon, the game's developer, is just picking random numbers for the payments, this bit of evidence would be meaningless. Except that he's not. At the end of Five Night's 2, you get paid $100.50. Divide that by the 30 hours worked, and you get $3.35 an hour, the EXACT minimum wage for 1987. Which means that us using minimum wage calculations to identify the year of Five Nights 1 IS a perfectly valid way to prove it, and shows that it takes place AFTER the events of Five Nights 2. Still don't believe me? Players brave enough to survive the extra night six are rewarded with a bonus check and a newspaper clipping that says the toy robots are getting scrapped, and that the old ones are going into storage for a new, smaller scale version of the restaurant. That would explain why the old models reappear in Five Nights 1, and the toy models don't. And notice how it mentions a SMALLER version of the restaurant. The building in Five Nights 1 is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than the setting of Five Nights 2. Need more evidence? What about the fact that on the first night in the office, the phone guy explains that the robots used to walk around during the day, just like they do in Five Nights 2, but not anymore. Or the fact that Phone Guy DIES in the first game, making it hard for him to also be the phone guy in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 if it takes place after. Call me the Phantom Menace, 'cause every way to Sunday, this game is a prequel. So with that revelation out of the way, we're able to peace together the rest of the timeline and dig a little bit deeper. Posters everywhere in Five Nights 2 welcome you to this new location, Implying that there was another Freddy Fazbear's pizza somewhere before this one. Additionally, the phone guy makes reference to it on night one, mentioning the old location and how it was left to rot. So, we know that there was one Freddy Fazbear's Pizza for the first game, one for the second game, and one that came before both of them that we've never seen. But even before THAT, the phone guy ALSO mentions an even older restaurant called 'Fredbear's Family Diner,' which, aside from its confusingly different name, also had different owners. So, let me recap; There's the restaurant from the first game, which is the last in the timeline, the one that you're currently working at in 1987 in Five Nights 2, an older location of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria left to rot, and the original Fredbear's Diner. Jeez, I hope you're still with me because this is more complicated than the Zelda Timeline! Anyway, it's at this first location, the diner, where the whole story begins. Submitted for the approval of The Game Theorists' Society, THIS is the true tale of Five Nights at Freddy's. When you die in Five Night's at Freddy's 2, before you've even gotten over the jump-scare, you sometimes get a screen like this. Oh, turn it off! Turn it off, it's too horrifying! That, youngsters, was ET for the Atari, a console that came out BEFORE the NES. Yes, around the same time as the dinosaurs. It's widely considered to be the worst game of all time, hence me reacting in a horrified manner. See? Humor, folks! But seriously, you get these disturbing death mini-games which, true to the 1987 setting, use Atari-esque graphics to depict various horrific events. All the while, a creepy robotic voice spells out letter by letter, thing like: These death mini-games are THE MOST IMPORTANT piece in figuring out the true story behind these games. Let's start with this one: This death mini-game has you playing as Freddy, taking cake to screaming children at a birthday party. As Freddy rushes around trying to keep the whole party happy, a single sad child looks on from outside, and suddenly, you're powerless to do anything but look on in abject horror as a purple man pulls up in a car, murders the child, and drives off. It's my belief, loyal theorists, that this game takes place at Fredbear's Diner. And is chronologically the first event that we see in this timeline. How do I know? Well, it's a small establishment, and there's only one animatronic: Freddy, as opposed to all the other games which show other robots. But more importantly, this murdered child is the one that sets EVERYTHING into motion. One of the new tasks added to Five Night's at Freddy's 2 is winding a mysterious music box, that we're told placates one of the animatronics. If you fail to wind the music box, what you're introduced to is THIS terrifying thing: THE PUPPET. Looks like No Face from Spirited Away. You know what else he looks like? Take a look at that murdered child again. See how his tear tracks remain visible on his face, even after he's dead? If we assume that they'll continue to stay with him into the afterlife, we can make a pretty good case that this kid's murdered spirit eventually found its way into the puppet animatronic. But that's not all. What jump-scare happens after this 'Save Him' mini-game? After seeing this tear-stained child's murder reenacted in 8-bit, the puppet. The puppet jumps out of the screen, and attacks you. Coincidence? I don't think so. That incident marks the first time the chain is ever associated with a violent act carried out against a child, and we can infer that it was this incident that caused the original owners of Fredbear's Diner to sell off to the company now known as Fazbear Entertainment. Now, I don't know about you, but if I was senselessly murdered and left to haunt a crappy pizza place for the rest of my life in the body of an awful looking clown doll, I'd want to get my revenge as soon as possible. Unfortunately for our vengeful puppet, though, it doesn't quite turn out that way. Fast forward a few years to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The first location. The one that has yet to appear in a game. This new restaurant is the one we learned about in my earlier episode, and throughout the first game, where our pal, the murderer, uses a Golden Freddy suit to lure away and kill five children in the backroom. As we read through the various articles on the wall, he gets caught the next day, but the bodies are never found. Presumably because they've been stuffed into the animatronic suits. The restaurant stays open for a few months, until the dead body stink starts to waft off the robots, and causes the place to get shut down for health reasons. But how do we KNOW this happened in the first pizzeria's location? Again, we turn to what the phone guy says. On night two of Five Night's 2, he mentions the smell coming from the old animatronics; the smell that got the original restaurant shut down. We also know that after the Golden Freddy incident, it took multiple months for the restaurant to get shut down. That couldn't have happened in the restaurant of Five Nights at Freddy's 2, which is shut down on night six, and into the foreseeable future. But outside of these lore clues, it also makes logical sense. Before the Golden Freddy murders, there was one dead child whose tear-stained soul existed in the form of the puppet. But now, there are five more dead children, and thanks to another of the death mini-games, we find out exactly what happened to them. In the 'Help Them' mini-game, the puppet stuffs the dead children into the robotic suits, giving their souls new life, and preps them for their eternal mission of vengeance. "But, but MatPat!" you say through your chattering teeth. "There are only FOUR dead children in that game!" to which I tell you, look closer, if you dare, for the frame RIGHT before Golden Freddy's head jumps out and attacks features the lost fifth dead child, and what started as a haunted puppet has suddenly become an army of possessed animatronics out for revenge. But wait! That's not all we know. We also know the murder was committed by the same guy who killed the first child. How? Look at the Foxy death mini-game. Twice, Foxy runs out to meet the kids, but the third time, we see the tall purple man again, smiling. Foxy goes into the other room to find five dead children. The man in purple strikes again. Skip ahead to 1987, FINALLY bringing us to the events of Five Nights at Freddy's 2. The old animatronics have been retired. The cute new versions of all our favorite friends come equipped with facial recognition software that just so happens to be connected to a sex offender database. Seems like an oddly specific detail right? until you consider that the last resturant was closed for having children get kidnapped and killed by an employee. It's a safety measure , you see how it all ties together? So you have some animatronics possessed by vengeful spirits and another batch on the prowl for predators but that doesn't stop our the purple man from continuing his life's work of murdering children at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. As we learn from phone guy on nights 4-6 the new restaurant is, once again, under investigation as, well... I'll let him explain. *Phone Guy speaking* MatPat: The Golden Freddy killer struck again. The final death mini-game also supports this. You, as Freddy, must walk through an exact replica of the building. Animatronics all in their proper places. Seeing the five dead children spread out through the various rooms. And based on what phone guy says it seems like the guilty party was the former night guard. The one who moved to day shift and the one your character replaced. I mean phone guy makes plenty of uncomfortable references to suddenly having an available position during the day. *Phone Guy speaking* MatPat: But is the purple man Really someone we've never met? And who's only worked there a week? Or is it some one we trust, someone with a long history with these characters, someone no one would suspect? The head guard, the one forced to fill empty positions and teach new recruits by leaving them instructions over the phone. Is the purple man the phone guy? Ask yourself this: Let's look at what he says, first, he always speaks like an outsider looking in. He refers to the management of the company as "they." So, he's not a higher up like the CEO or even a manager. But he is also not a typical day worker as he says things like: "The employees" and "the staff" So, he works there, but isn't generally considered a regular member of the company. We also know that he is qualified to take the role of a night guard, as we learn he is plans to take over the position sometime after night six and is on his way out of the position by the time the first game starts. *Phone Guy speaking* *Phone Guy speaking* MatPat: What else do we know? Well, we know that phone guys has a long history with the company, being with it at least since the first pizzeria that we haven't played in. He also openly admits that Foxy the pirate was always his favorite, and that he has never liked the puppet because, as he says, it was always thinking. *Phone Guy speaking* MatPat: Ok, but what do we know about the purple guy? The golden Freddy killer... Well, let's look at the mini-games again He has a long history with the franchise, killing since it was Fredbear Diner We see him smiling as he watches Foxy perform phone guy's favorite right before Foxy sees the room of dead children. We KNOW that the puppet and the killer wouldn't get along, which would explain Phone Guy's discomfort around a creature that he describes as 'always thinking.' And here's the bombshell: We know the killer is a security guard. How? On very rare occasions during the SAVE THEM mini-game, while Freddy chases the puppet, the purple man appears and chases you. Look on his chest, it's an orange badge, the kind of would be given to a security guard. Now look at his eyes, notice the white spots? An odd seemingly innocuous detail; but now, look at Golden Freddy, look deep into his dead vacant eyes. What do you see? Two white spots, pinpricks really, barely visible but they're there. And now finally, what do we see in purple guy's hand? While the Atari graphics make it tough to discern, it's not like any gun or knife I've seen. No, that to me is very clearly a phone. The robotic voice is spelling out for you "Save them, SAVE THEM!" But when purple guy, Phone Guy, catches you.. the screen crashes and all you're left with is "you can't" But that's not where it ends, internet. As you and I both know, there's still Five Nights at Freddy's 1. If this game is last in line and the puppet is truly pulling the strings behind all of this, you might be asking yourself where he is in Five Nights 1. We know the other animatronics got scrapped, but this ghostly guy should still be around if this timeline I propose is correct. Get this, the puppet IS in the first game. Take a look at the East hallway, seems pretty normal, right? But every so often the posters on the walls change to this a crying child with two streaming lines down his face. Look familiar? It should. The Five Nights at Freddy's series is about vengeance. One child, six children, more... Looking for revenge against a sick child killer. The purple guy, the guy who just so happens to be the first voice you hear in turning on these games. Save them SAVE THEM... You can't... But hey, that's just a theory... a Game Theory. Thanks for watching. Make sure you wind that music-box by clicking the subscribe button, otherwise the puppet might get ya... click it... CLICK IT... *Mouse Click* Oh, I guess you were safe after all. It's almost the holiday break, you know what I like to do during this time of love and gladness? Catch up on my favorite TV shows. But at this point, I don't have cable and should probably avoid pirating things. Which is why I subscribed to HuluPLUS. and by clicking the link in the description or typing in huluplus.com/matpat You can get a free two-week trial of non-stop binge watch for all your favorite shows. Like Bleach, One Piece, Family Guy, Sword Art Online II. Or if you're like me, you'll probably relive the glory days of the 90's by marathoning Sabrina the Teenage Witch for days on end. Uh... get together with Harvey already! While everyone else is fighting hoards at the mall; you, the smart one, will have done your online shopping and be lounging around working your way through season one of Drunk History. So get your two-week free trial by clicking on huluplus.com/matpat The weather outside may be frightful but the HuluPLUS is so delightful. That was admittedly very cheesy. * Beware of the man who speaks in hands. * Really? I find people who speak in sign language to be rather pleasant actually.

Welcome to Game Theory, where--deep breath-- [inhale, exhale] I think I'm finally ready to tackle Undertale again. But OVERLY DRAMATIC GAME THEORY VOICE aside, I gotta be honest with ya. I'm scared of this game. So, before we begin today's episode, I need to take a moment to level with you all- because it's time I pull back the curtain on this show a bit and address a couple things. Now, don't get me wrong. I LOVE this game. I really do. But doing episodes on Undertale have been some of the worst experiences that I've had in the six years of doing this show. The first was "Sans is Ness," a theory I was so excited to share with you. In fact, it was one of, if not my FAVORITE episode that we had done of Game Theory to date because it allowed me an opportunity to talk about one of my favorite franchises growing up - Earthbound, as well as one of my favorite modern franchises of Undertale. And it was a fun episode! Now, don't get me wrong. Did I in any way think that this was canon lore to the series? No. Of course not. I didn't think that Sans is actually Ness. But at the end of the day, these are theories meant to get you to think about things from a different perspective. And let's be honest here--there are a lot of similarities between Earthbound and Undertale, okay? From visual design to actual sound effects to even the timelines of the games. But the overwhelming negativity and ridicule that that video got was just... it was just crushing. It sucked, man. And don't get me wrong, I have gotten used to dealing with Internet hate over the years. I've gotten through the "Sonic is Slow" controversy, I've had literal petitions written to remove me from the Internet for slandering Mario's name by calling him a sociopath, -but this one. This one hurt. But it was nothing compared to the next time I talked about Undertale on the channel, when I was selected for the honor of meeting Pope Francis as one of the first ten digital creators to introduce him to the world of online video. And, as part of that, we were expected to give him a gift. So, I gave him a copy of Undertale and then made a video talking about that. One, because it was such a huge honor for me, but two, because I was excited to share it with you. This was our achievement as a Theorist community, as-as gamers, as online digital creators and people who love online things. And the HATE that that video received in the first week -- I mean, this was a video where I specifically talk about accepting others and saying NO to hating other groups of people, and it got hate. I just-- you gotta love the Internet sometimes, man. Now, I tend to stay quiet in situations like that, since I've learned that fighting back only seems to make the problem worse. But since I'm talking about Undertale, and since I know all of those comments are gonna come flooding back on this video, I figured, let me address some of the misconceptions and errors that were leveled against me when I first released that video. One, I talked to the Pope about cyberbullying in schools. I did not - as many people wrongfully accused me of - waste his time talking to him about video games or "gamer problems." In fact, my entire conversation with the Pope is available on YouTube right now. If you had actually taken a couple minutes to do research before assuming and accusing me of things, it would've actually saved me a LOT of sleepless nights. Two, the gift of the game was symbolic. Of course, the Pope isn't gonna play a video game, but three, if you thought that the gift of a video game was bad and had problems with that one, at least it was better than a surfboard, an illegal tree, and a YouTuber's self-written book about themselves: all things that the Pope also received as gifts that day. Which leads me to number four: yes, obviously other games talked about peaceful solutions before Undertale, but jeez! I like the game, it was recent at the time, and it was the Pope's Year of Mercy, and I don't know if you've noticed, but the word "mercy" appears a whole heck of a lot in Undertale. And lastly, number five. I was selected via an application that I submitted for this opportunity as a representative of America, as a representative of gamers, and of online digital creators. I know a lot of people were upset that I was selected and I'm sorry if you don't like me. But as someone who tries to advocate for science, logic, and critical thought, I did my best to put a good foot forward for all three of those different categories. And, you know what? I did my best. I tried. Anyway, enough of me talking on camera, lets hop back into the video 'cause...no need to see this on camera anymore. I just thought it was important to talk to you. Mano y mano. (Hand and hand.) So, as you can probably tell, after those two videos, I wasn't SUPER enthusiastic about tackling Undertale too much. Anyway, in the wake of all the tension going on in the world lately, I played through Undertale again and was filled with determination to try and do another episode on it. It was the most requested episode you loyal Theorists wanted back when the game first came out, and to not cover it felt like just leaving the series unfinished. And I'm not the type to give up. So here we are, back in the ring for round three to answer everyone's biggest question about the series: Who is Gaster? From what I can tell on Reddit, despite all the theorizing in the months after the game's release, it looks like most people ended up throwing in the towel, writing this mysterious character off as some code Toby Fox tossed in at the end of the development of the game to get people speculating, but without ever coming up with a fully fleshed-out story of his own. I, however, disagree. After looking at all the evidence from a ton of different sources-- in the game itself, in the game's code, dug up from places like the Underminer community, from Toby Fox's own statements and my own scientific look at things, I think you can come up with a fairly solid theory of who Gaster is and what happened to him. So no more sins crawling up my back! I present to you my theory on W.D. Gaster... Part One. Because there's a lot to cover here. And, like, seriously, if those opening stories weren't enough to convince you that I would LOVE for this to be a single-parter, then I don't know what to tell ya. I know two-parters get a ton of hate and the LAST thing that I want is more Internet shame to be thrown at me on an Undertale video. But I want to give this theory the time and research that it deserves. So just TRUST me that it has to be two parts for my OWN sanity and to make this a better viewing experience for you. 'Cause otherwise, it would be an under-edited, overly rushed one-part episode where I crammed in everything and didn't do a good job of explaining it all, okay? [sigh] Wow. I am unloading all sorts of emotional baggage on this episode. All the stuff that has been weighing on me... as a creator... for the longest time. Let's start off with the easy stuff to get everyone on the same page, since it's possible that some of you are like, "I've played Undertale all the way through, three times-- Neutral, Pacifist, and Genocide, watched Jack, Felix, and eventually Mark play it, and still have no idea who you're talking about." Well, that's because your chances of running into any evidence of this character in the game is a slim 2.8 percent. That's right--I did the math. In other words, you could play through the game a hundred times and you'd only find references to Gaster about three of those times. Holy Temmie flakes, Batman! Those are some slim chances! So let's back up for a minute and quickly talk about what we know about this character for sure. The first hints of Gaster came from the River Person in his now-infamous line of "Beware the man who speaks in hands." Now, obviously, this got players more excited than an annoying dog with a stick, since, you know, there's no one in the game who does anything close to "speaking in hands," and, in a game already full of hidden secrets and fake clues, this appeared to be another big one. So they started digging. What they found were four gray NPCs, labelled in the game files as Monster Kid Goner and three G Followers, or Gaster Followers, with dialogue that provides us the only solid information that we have about this missing character. Through their text, we learn that Dr. W.D. Gaster was the Royal Scientist before Alphys, was responsible for building the Core, i.e. the structure that provides magical power to the Underground, and that he disappeared after falling into his creation, getting himself scattered across time and space. Although he may not be PHYSICALLY present, he's SUPPOSEDLY always around, since these guys are all SUPER reluctant to discuss him openly. And, beyond that, mostly everything else is speculation. There are these Mystery Man images in the game data that many speculate might be him, but, um... flip this character upside-down (here, you don't have to imagine it--we can do it through the POWER OF EDITING) and boom! This could also be him. See the face? Just like so many other things in this game, appearances may be deceiving. There's ALSO this wispy white thing that could ALSO-also be him, according to online theories, but again, it's all just speculation. GAME SPECULATION! [Sting-edited Game Theory theme] So, where does all this speculation end up and the theorizing begin? Well, theories are hypothesies supported by evidence, so let's start gathering evidence. Now, whether or not the gray NPCs show up is based on a weird stat programmed into the code called the "Fun Value." Basically, whenever you start a new game, Undertale picks a random number between one and a hundred. Depending on what number you get, different things happen in the game. Keeps things spicy. It also keeps things really similar to FNaF, when you come to think about it. Seriously, are we sure that these two fanbases really hate each other? 'Cause no joke, between wacky animal hi-jinx, [ding] hidden plot mysteries, [ding] random easter eggs, [ding] and large quantities of murdered children, [ding] (The two franchises are a lot more similar than I think people want to admit.) ANYWAY, these gray NPCs show up with the Fun Values at 61, 62, 63, or higher than 90. And even if the number IS there, they only have a 20 percent chance of showing up PER GAME, which is why your chances of ever even seeing them is so low. Even creepier, if you have a Fun Value of 66, this eerie gray door appears in Waterfall. When you walk through it, there's a chance that the Mystery Man appears. Touch him, and poof! He peaces out faster than a babysitter's boyfriend when the parents come home. And the Fun Value dictates more than just Gaster encounters and secret rooms. When you played Undertale, did you get a call from Sans about your refrigerator running? Or maybe someone called you with a wrong number, and then you got a really random song out of it? Or Alphys called to order some pizza? Well, all of those situations were dictated by your Fun Value. So, why spend all this time talking about fun? Well, because it's the start of the mystery. If there's one thing we know, is that the worde of Undertale, game mechanics AREN'T JUST game mechanics Toby Fox makes it clear throughout the game that game mechanics make up the very fabric of the game's reality These aren't just artificial invisible layers on top of the story for player to use while interacting with the game Thase RUELS, from SAVING to LOADING and everything in-between all encompass the actual physical laws of Undertale's universe, much like quantum mechanics and general relativity define ours. Character stats like Lvl, or level of violence and EXP, or execution points in any other game would be numbers relevant only to the player But in Undertale, they're real, tangable values that characters, most notably Sans, can sense and judge. So if Fun is what dictates the appearance or non-appearance of a bunch of these characters connected to Gaster, well, than it BAHOOVES us to figure out what Fun acually is in the context of the game. And if you're under the mistaken impression that Fun is a sense of childlike glee that often comes when playing a game, then you are WRONG! (*thud*) you're just WRONG The Fun Value in Undertale is the embodiment of the very real theory from quantum mechanics known as the Many Worlds interpretation. It's a favorite of mine here on Game Theory applicable to everything from from the Zelda timeline to the Pokémon universe, so since I've covered it a few times, I'm not gonna go in depth here, Click the "i" icon in the upper right hand corner to check out THOSE videos where I spend a bit more time explaining it LONG story short, the Many Worlds interpretation involves the measurement of photons and wave/particle duality but in a nutshell, imagine you're starting a new game of Undertale. You have the option of going True Pacifist or Genocide. Now, In that moment, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, it DOESN'T matter which you choose. If you choose a pacifist run, there's an alternate reality where you went FULL ON HOMICIDAL MANIAC! And vice versa! All possible realities simultaneously exist. Each time you're presented with an option to either kill or show mercy to a new character, two new timelines are created, one for each option. And THIS is where we get back to Gaster and his followers. You see, if you find him, Goner Kid speaks the following line: Well, in my first play through of the game, that's exactly what happened, A world where he didn't exist! In fact, I must've gotten a really lame Fun Value since I didn't find ANYONE mentioning Gaster. No secret rooms, no one even wanted to call me! truly... i was forever alone. :'( But there are realities where he DOES exist! and where sans DOES pick up the phone to call you. In short, think of each new Fun Value as another world in the Many Worlds interpretation; another timeline. Parallel realities where one small detail is different. Goner Kid does or does not exist. Alphys does or does not order pizza. So the next time someone tells you to go outside and have some fun, all you really gotta do is create an alternate reality in your own backyard! Simple as that! But not only does this Fun Value make repeated play throughs of the game interesting, but it makes a world, (pun intended) of difference, when it comes to Gasters story line. From speaking to the Gaster Followers, we know that an experiment went wrong and that Gaster was shattered across time and space. Those are some pretty specific words. First, SHATTERED. As in pieces of him went in many different directions. There are multiple pieces of Gaster that now exist. And then there are the operative words of "TIME AND SPACE". Meaning that these pieces ended up across many different timelines. The many different worlds each represented by a different Fun Value. But what other characters do we know are able to retain memories across multiple different timelines? Only two; Flowey and Sans. Flowey tells us at the end of the Genocide run that he's lived hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of timelines, doing everything under the sun from being nice to people to torturing them. And in the True Pacifist run, Asriel, Flowey's true identity, makes mention of being able to "destroy this timeline once and for all". Asriel even says the following lines: It's a really specific thing for Asriel to know, that killing something over and over again will cause the memories of it to fade in everyone's minds. In fact, we may even know someone who he's done this to: Goner Kid! Asriel's speech during the final battle is a direct parallel to the same lines we just saw Goner Kid speak a few minutes ago! A world where he no longer exists! The thought terrifies him. Almost as though Asriel did this to him to the point where he does... no longer exist... Sans on the other hand, isn't as powerful as Flowey from a time manipulation perspective, but he does bend the laws of space around him. Phasing through walls, and during his battle continually teleports over and over and over again! Though he doesn't show the ability to SAVE or RELOAD like Flowey does, he openly acknowledges that there are other sans-es out there in other realities and tells you to say hello to them! He has tests in place to know if someone is a time traveller. And even though he can't outright control time, he has some at least deeper understanding of timelines being manipulated. As evidence by his various dialogue options when you fight him over and over during the final Genocide battle. Sensing how many times he's beaten you. So is it any wonder that the two characters who together manipulate time and space both wield weapons that look like this. And that, at least for Sans, this weapon, according to the sprite files, happens to be called: a Gaster Blaster Or that for Flowey, this is the weapon that he specifically calls out will destroy the timeline! In fact, as you can imagine, there's a LOT more to say about the Sans-Flowey-Gaster connection. But before we do, lets quickly recap. Gaster; the Man who Speaks in Hands and the Royal Scientist before Alphys, is an entity only known about through his four followers. Ones that only appear in certain timelines of the game. These timelines are ultimately dictated by a random Fun Value. With him being shattered across time and space, he must share some connection with the other two characters that seemingly strangle time and space, Flowey and Sans, And INDEED he does, in the form of his Gaster Blasters. But there's more. SOOO much more! From the Determination expiriments, to information found in the True Lab, to Toby Fox's Twitter, to the PIVOTAL CLUE THAT MAKES SENSE OF ALL OF THIS..! The word search. No joke. But that's for next time, when we get into deep lore talk, neuro-scientific analysis, and much more to finally reveal the truth... behind W.D. Gaster. So make sure to ring the subscription bell for the notification of when that video is coming out by clicking right HERE, and you'll be the first to see it. Just about 10 days from now (its out now, go see it) if you're watching this the day it's uploaded (which you're not) so its not that long (yes, those 2 weeks were absolute torture for me) you know it's coming. Its not like Doctor Who Part 3, which is existing in this nebulus non-existent world. There's a final date to this one. And hey, you know what? There's even gonna be a For Honor Game Theory thats sandwiched in next week to keep you more entertained, 'cause that's a cool game! It's a fun theory that talks about Vikings, Samurai, and Knights, so that's pretty cool. Look, NO one likes a two-parter, least of all me since it gets everyone to complain about it but hey. I'm looking out for you guys. But you... you gotta look out for me too. 'Cause you know what? That extra time is gonna make the final theory that much better. Alright? So, in the meantime, remember.... That's just a theory! A Game Theory!

 Move over, Walter White, there's a new anti-hero in town, and his name is Mario Jumpman Mario [Game Theory Theme Plays] Hello, Internet Welcome to Game Theory! Where we put the "O!" in Super Mario. Huh, sorry, "Super" Mario? More like Super Villain! Because behind those plump cheeks, that bulbous nose and that 80's pornstar mustache is a truly evil man. And let me make it clear: no, that's not a joke. This isn't a "syke, fooled you guys!" moment like we did when we were disproving Mario's communist connections, nor is this mere speculation like when we looked at the franchise's link to staged kidnappings. No, after doing the research I am convinced that this so-called hero of the Mushroom Kingdom is in fact a murderous, womanizing, animal abuser; a cruel, misanthropic sociopath. Do I have your attention now? Get ready to have your worlds rocked, theorists, 'cause this one is going to be a doozy that will forever change how you feel about gaming's biggest mascot! The warning signs were present from the very beginning: Donkey Kong for the arcade featured Mario's first appearance, but even in those early days, something was off. The story, as we know it, goes like this: A giant ape steals Mario's girlfriend, and the heroic Italian must get her back. That's it. And it sounds good in theory, but have you ever stopped to consider why Donkey Kong steals the girl in the first place? Of course not. Raised on movies like "King Kong" and years of damsel-in-distress fairytales we just assume we're the good guys, fighting the evil primate to save the girl. But you know what they say about assuming, don't you? It makes an ass out of you and me. Here's the truth, or rather, the rest of the story. Did you know that Mario was Donkey Kong's master? That he abused the ape, which is why D.K. broke free and stole away with Mario's GF. To get even. Yeah, that's a factoid you don't hear Nintendo trumpeting about their red-clad cash cow! Now you would be one hundred percent correct in asking me: "Well, where does it say that Mario was D.K.'s master?" The arcade game didn't come with a story and ports to Atari and Coleco Vision give a vague "Mario must save the girl" plot. Other sources like Cracked.com or Wikipedia cite the book "Geektionary", which I checked out, but here at GT we try not to to rest until we have primary sources. So I dug a little deeper, and found this. I give you: Donkey Kong Circus, from the Game & Watch Gallery, the prequel to the original Donkey Kong where we see Jumpman's side business where he just so happens to be running a circus show and the star attraction: Donkey Kong. D.K. juggling pineapples and avoiding fireballs all while balancing atop a barrel. Made to look like a fool, forced to burn his hands, scolded and laughed at when missing a pineapple clearly not the proper way for a great ape to be treated. A master willfully putting his pet into uncomfortable situations, physically injuring them with fire, laughing at and humiliating them, Mario's lucky that the Tanooki suit is the only thing that got PETA's attention! Ohoho, but dear theorists, we've only just begun. If we're talking Mario's predilection for animal abuse, we don't even need to troll the obscure reaches of the Game & Watch Gallery- Mario doesn't do much to hide his violent tendencies. In the wake of Donkey Kong, upset at being forced to climb girders for his girl, Mario punishes his freshly captured ape in their next game together: Donkey Kong Jr. where he tears Donkey Kong away from his son, cages him up, and then uses a whip to defend his prize. In the final screen, Mario even whips birds to do his bidding! But what's worse than his treatment of the adult Kong is his abuse of the younger ape. Think about what we're seeing here: Mario is forcing a baby monkey to cheat death in order to rescue his father! Just look at the utter distress and the fear on that poor ape's young face! In the third screen, he uses a lever to actively try to electrocute D.K. Jr. Let me reiterate that point: Mario, this icon of gaming, paragon of heroism, tries to electrocute a baby monkey for rescuing his father, a father who was put in danger and humiliated in a circus show run by a red-wearing carpenter who wields a whip. This is the behavior that we have ignored and overlooked, dear gamers. And this is the information that Nintendo has been happy to silently sweep under the rug. But wait, that's not all. We're pulling all the skeletons out of the closet this time. Mario is an equal opportunity animal abuser; he also hates insects. Take, for instance, Wigglers. Innocent, happy caterpillars that, across the Mario franchise, show absolutely zero intentions of ever hurting Mario. The have fu*ing daisies on their heads for crying out loud! And what does our "hero" do? He ruins their home not once, but twice, in both Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. Then, after trashing their homes, he proceeds to jump on them, crushing them to death. An innocent creature who did nothing wrong but get upset when his home was violated. From this perspective, Mario is no better than a child burning ants with a magnifying glass. torturing small insects just for fun. And Wigglers are only one of multiple examples. That's not even mentioning creatures like Cheep Cheeps, fish who are just swimming around peacefully not even attacking Mario, who get targeted, burned alive by Mario's fiery vengeance. But let's cut the guy some slack. Wigglers and the rest are "enemies" in the game because, you know, Mario's supposedly the hero and stuff. What's inexcusable though, is his mistreatment of his family and his allies. Take, for instance, the Yoshi. We learn in the beginning of Yoshi's Island that these cute dinos are responsible for saving Mario's life! To recap: A stork drops baby Mario, who, as luck would have it, lands safely on the back of a Yoshi. The rest of the game has a team of Yoshis Yoshii? Yoshis. Yoshis risking their lives to reunite the baby with his kidnapped brother, then delivering the two back to their parents. A cute story, right? Heartwarming. Get's ye' right there. Well, fast forward to adult Mario, hopping once more atop his trusted and loyal friend to save the day and- wait, he just punched him. Look again: Mario punches the Yoshis to get them to extend their tongue. You can even see the Yoshi flinch before it happens! He is physically beating this animal to get it to do what he wants it to do. And let's not forget that Mario will drop a Yoshi into a pit without hestitation just to get a couple extra inches out of his jump. A pit that, time and time again has clearly been shown to result in death. Once again, we don't just see animal abuse- we see family abuse. Lest we forget, this is Yoshi, the same creature who had to deal with this [baby Mario's obnoxious crying] and this [final boss Bowser music] to keep baby Mario safe. These tender-hearted dinosaurs are practically family and what do they get? A punch and a pit! Disposable like tissues. If only they had fed that obnoxious baby to a Piranha Plant, the Mushroom Kingdom would be a happier, and safer, place. Speaking of abusing family though, this next one, in my opinion, is Mario's worst sin: his treatment of Luigi. Now, stop for a minute and look at this guy. He's an adorable coward, an awkward wannabe hero who thinks the world of his brother. Look at the way he reacts at the ending of Luigi's Mansion when he sees his brother is safe. Even though it's told mostly through gestures and goofy sounds, his joy is moving. Without doubt, Luigi is one of the sweetest, most genuine characters in gaming. In Paper Mario, you can read his secret diary which goes on and on for pages about how much he admires Mario, how much he wishes he could go on these adventures, how he's asked over and over to be included on the next big quest. And what we read is that Mario has crushed those dreams, crushed them like the thousands of Goombas he's crushed under his fat Italian weight. denying his brother any chance of fulfilling his dreams of living a happy life. But it gets worse than sheer neglect. Look at the ending of New Super Mario Brothers Wii. Luigi flies in, offers Mario and Peach room in his balloon, and then they just fly off without him. They don't acknowledge his existence, they don't thank him, they don't invite him to fly with them, they just flat out ignore him. He is less than the Koopa remnant on the bottom of Mario's shoes. Luigi doesn't get any thanks at the end of Mario is Missing, either. After Luigi has completed this quest, Mario just strolls out and stands there, fu*ing stands there, no thank you, no nothing, just staring at his brother like: "I hope you liked the lamest adventure in our franchise, bro, 'cause the most you're ever going to get." But what's disgusting, and I mean DISGUSTING, is Mario's behavior at the end of Mario Power Tennis. Yeah, we're pulling out the real obscure games to get to the heart of this jack@#$. Does it sound like I'm fired up? Yeah, 'cause I'm fired up. I am angry that I have been deceived by this sleazeball plumber for decades; that I have called him a hero, that I have been his fanboy. Here's why: In Mario Power Tennis, if Luigi wins, this is what happens: he celebrates. For once, this perpetual Player 2, this second fiddle gets his chance in the spotlight. People are cheering for him, a stadium full of people are celebrating Luigi, he's holding a trophy, and what does Mario do? The brother who Luigi would love the approval of more than anything else, what does he do? Walks up to him, applauding, laughing, slaps him on the back and then grinds his shoe into his brother's foot! Stands there and grinds it in. [Mario Power Tennis music and Mario's sporadic laughter] Still smiling, still laughing. He is so unfeeling, so bereft of love or affection for anything or anyone, even his own brother, he's unwilling to let Luigi have even the smallest of victory in a game that no one cares about. And look at Luigi: his moment of glory is ruined! The brother he thought would be proud of him in this moment of victory instead trashes upon it! It flies completely against everything Luigi has ever associated with his brother and the look on his face proves it! He's confused, he's bewildered, and we should be too. We've been lied to, and if nothing else I've talked about today shows Mario's disturbing, cruel nature this moment, this willingness to smile in your face while doing something completely awful and selfish shows how evil he is! And you know what? There's more, lots more. Besides torturing monkeys, besides destroying the homes of animals, beyond beating and killing dinosaurs and beyond being a cruel, heartless brother. Mario's sins continue, so join me next week- yes, next week, as we conclude our trial of gaming's biggest icon, exposing his fondness for women and murder. Have I convinced you yet? If not, there's still plenty more to go. In the meantime, it's just a theory. A game theory! Thanks for watching! [record scratching] Seriously though, have I convinced you? Well, click on one to vote, and before you do, make sure you subscribe so that you don't miss next week's thrilling conclusion. And last time, Charmander won by 3% over Squirtle; Bulbasaur, sadly, didn't have a chance.  All rise. The trial of Mario "Jumpman" Mario continues. Witness for the prosecution? DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNN [Game Theory Theme Song] Hello Internet, welcome to Game Theory. Where we, get this, theorize about games. Shocking, I know. But seriously, if this was "The Matrix", by watching this show, you'd be choosing the red pill. And that would make me Lawrence Fishburne. But white. Anyway, racial insensitivity aside... As a life long Nintendo fan, no topic has gotten me more fired up than this one. The true nature of Mario. Trust me, it gives me no pleasure to tell you that Mario is an opportunistic animal abuser or cruel, unfeeling brother like I did in part one of this duology, but the truth has been hidden from us long enough. Electrocuting baby apes, trampling his brother's victories, these aren't necessary for saving the Mushroom Kingdom. Instead, these are the moments that show his true personality. The one hidden behind his plastered-on smile and joyful "yahoo!" and while last episode started the sin counter, *High pitched sin ding* we're far from through as we dig through Mario's betrayal of both the woman and country he's trying to save. By the end, we'll have a pretty strong and surprising diagnosis of what's going on inside the head of gaming's biggest mascot. So let's talk for a minute about "Mario the Manwhore". Sure, we all know that Princess Peach is Mario's main squeeze now, Wow, matpat sure is a *DING*us but it's easy to overlook his flings with other women. Take for instance, Pauline, The girl stranded atop the girders in "Donkey Kong" may appear to have the same fashion sense as the Toadstool Princess, but one look at the promotional boxart of our damsel in distress shows us that Pauline is a very different type of gal. Wearing tight, low-cut red dresses, Pauline is certainly a departure of from the buttoned up, kiss on the cheek prone Peach. Pauline: "Ohhh Mario~" (Orgasmic and sensual) And yes, while Pauline and Mario were in love long before Mario's adventures in the Mushroom Kingdom began, the feelings that drive a man to leap over anthropomorphic fireballs to rescue his lady love die hard. Case in point, the Mario Vs. Donkey Kong series. Where, after years of absence, Pauline makes her grand return as Mario's quote unquote "special guest" For those of you who are unfamiliar with this more obscure series, Mario is debuting a new theme park based around his hit toy line. And his V.I.P. guest at the ribbon cutting is... Pauline. No signs of Peach anywhere. Now, as a committed man myself, I speak with authority when I say: Later, in Mini-Land Mayhem, she even gets her own toy modeled after her. There's no Peach toy. And speaking of old habits dying hard, when DK kidnaps her and Mario comes to the rescue, she refers to him as "her hero". If there were any more red flags flying in this situation, I'd say that this was a communist conspiracy. Oh wait... (Shameless self-promotion) and before you leave waves of comments about this being either before or after a Peach-Mario celebrity breakup, timelines agree that the MVDK series takes place around the same time as New Super Mario and Super Mario RPG. a point in time when Mario is very clearly committed to the princess in pink. And even if you don't believe in Mario timelines, Nintendo has gone on record saying that this DK is an ancestor to this one. So clearly, some time has passed with these two maintaining a very close relationship. Sorry, Peach. Looks like Mario may be having his cake, and eating it too. AHA! But let's not forget Mario's other, other girl. Daisy. "But Daisy is Luigi's girl!", I hear you thinking. That's right, I can hear your thoughts. (Just imagine the thickest cheese in all of matpat history) Daisy may be Luigi's girl now, but everyone seems to forget her origin story. Princess of Sarasaland, she made her first appearance in Super Mario Land for the Gameboy. And yes, while the manuel and the promotional material may bill this as Mario saving just another princess out of the kindness of his heart, there's no denying what you see in the final scene of the game. "Oh, Daisy! Daisy!" he cries out when seeing her. Now, I'm sorry, but that's not how a friend greets another friend. Names only get repeated in romantic settings. Need more proof? (Phrasing) BOOM! That heart tells you everything you need to know about what's going on here. And once again, timelines list this game as occurring right after this. So very clearly, this is still very much a thing. And wait! This also means that, once again, we see Luigi getting the shaft. (Only sexual if you make it sexual) Mario dates a woman, tosses her aside, still expects her to play golf with them, and Luigi is left with the sloppy seconds. The hand-me-downs. The girl apparently not good enough to stay in Mario's little harem. So if Mario's crimes against animals and family aren't good enough, it seems he's also an adulterous plumber who can't keep his plunger in his pants. And while crimes of the heart are indeed serious, his ultimate betrayal is against the very people he's trying to protect. The denizens of the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario is a murderer murdurer murderoar Roar roar roar roar roar This "hero" of the Mushroom Kingdom has killed hundreds, thousands of Toads in his quest to "save" them from the evil clutches of Bowser. Look at the story from the original Super Mario Brothers. Quote, Uhhhh... It's here somewhere.. uh "The Kingdom was invaded by the Koopa" Uh... black magic... Ah! There we go. "The quiet, peace loving mushroom people" A.K.A. Toads "were turned into mere stones, bricks, and even field" "horse hair plants" whatever that is. (I believe that these are the piranha plants) blah-de-blah-de-blah... "The only one who could undo the magic is the Princess Toadstool." There you have it. Each and every brick you shatter is someone you were supposed to be saving. And the game takes it one step further! Rewarding you for killing them; giving you points for each and every block you smash. Earning points for killing people? That's what happens when you play the anti-hero. Games like GTA, Overlord, Prototype. Not fu(censor) Mario Brothers! And if the original games were bad, look at his behavior with a Mega Mushroom! Look at his utter lack of concern for anything in his way! Knowing full well that each and every thing in front of him is an actual resident of the kingdom. He even celebrates his massacre when he finishes! And while we're talking about his murderous tendencies, let's talk for a minute about Mario's preferred method of delivering death. Crushing. While the game makes it seem all for fun, it's pretty disturbing when you think about it. In fact, to prove the point, let's get morbid for a second here while I tell you a story. In Southeast Asia, as recently as the late 19th century, a popular form of execution was by elephant. One variation involved elephants trained to crush each and every limb of a prisoner's body that wasn't vital. Shattering the arms and legs, letting the victim slowly suffer as long as possible before finally releasing its full weight onto the victim's head and chest. Crushing the bones. Spraying brains and viscera everywhere. Now, did that make you uncomfortable? Make you cringe? Could you see yourself being repulsed by that sort of thing? GOOD! Because it's normal for someone to react that way! You know who doesn't? Mario. In fact, he relishes in it. Yipping and yee-hawing as he leaps from one flattened corps to the next. He has no sense of guilt. No sense of remorse. Police officers forced to kill in the line of duty have second thoughts. Soldiers forced to kill on the battlefields often suffer from PTSD. Bad guys or no, Mario should be feeling something. Anything other than joy, knowing that he's ending the existence of so many living creatures. You know who else doesn't have any remorse for their crimes? The Joker, Hannibal Lecter, Mr. Hyde, Ted Bundy, Lumberjack Dexter. These are all men with Antisocial Personality Disorder. Actual psychopaths. And Mario fits right in. They're all men characterized by their inability to form attachments or have any real empathy for others. Despite being charming and personable on the outside. They hold steady jobs, even have families. Girlfriends! But can be impulsive and sexually promiscuous. They're manipulative, they learn to mimic emotions, despite their inability to feel them. They appear normal. Happy in every sense, and yet they ruthlessly prey on everyone and everything around them. Sacrificing their safety, having no remorse for their actions. Deep down, they're arrogant. And to bring it all the way back around to where these two videos first started, often times, the first sign of someone with Antisocial Personality Disorder is their cruelty towards animals. Every single crime we've leveled against Mario across these two videos fits into this diagnosis. Animal cruelty, unloving brother, sexually deviant, remorseless murderer. I can definitively say Mario has Antisocial Personality Disorder. Behind that plastered-on smile. Behind that perpetually happy "It's-a-me!" is a monster. A man who has proven himself to be a threat to everything and everyone around him. He is no hero. We just haven't stopped to question him until now. Who would have thunk it? Mario. The most successful, unidentified serial killer ever. In the end though, if you think about it, it makes sense. There was only ever one piece of evidence we really needed to prove Mario's evil intentions. Damn you, blue shells...(How dare you matpat, I thought this was a show without curse word-okay I'll stop) [record scratch] So I bet you never knew that about Mario. but click here to hear some more things you probably didn't know about the guy and his games. I know I've been a little harsh on him over the last two videos, but hey, it's just a theory. A Game Theory! So I partnered up with DYKGaming to cut the guy some slack and really give him the credit he deserves. So hop on through the warp pipe to check out some more Mario-MatPat action over there. At the very least I need you to go defend my voice in the comments. Last time... Let's just say people were a little divided on what they heard.
